    <description>A Tetradactyly Utilizer. This augment is installed on Avali who do not expect to use their wings for flight. Taking the wing's fourth digit, they mold and bend it into a more forward position, practically giving the Avali a fourth finger for more practical usage. Whilst this may be the case, they lose most steering control with their wings and a lot of fellow Avali may find the inclusion of a fourth digit uncanny.</description>
