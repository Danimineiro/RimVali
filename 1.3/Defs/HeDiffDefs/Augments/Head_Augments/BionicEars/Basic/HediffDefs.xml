    <description>A basic bionic Avali ear. Whilst not necessarily better when compared to an organic one, the construction of this bionic directs vibrations a little better and as such still improves the hearing of the wearer by a small amount. But perhaps this augment is best used as a replacement for a lost ear instead of replacing a still functioning organic ones.</description>
