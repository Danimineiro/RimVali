    <label>Micro drone swarm (Construction)</label>
    <description>A pod containing a micro-drone swarm. When installed onto a pawn, they gain the ability to summon micro-drones from their body to assist them with certain tasks. Sadly enough these swarms are very resource intensive and as such can only be assigned to a singular task. This swarm has been made with construction in mind.</description>
